### To-Do List Application

This To-Do List application is a simple task management tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks, with all data stored in `localStorage` to ensure persistence even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

#### Key Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks using an input field. If left blank, an alert prompts the user to enter a task.
- **Mark as Complete**: Clicking on a task toggles its "checked" style to indicate completion.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task includes a trash icon to remove it from the list easily.
- **Persistent Storage**: `localStorage` saves tasks, so they remain after page reloads.

This To-Do List is a lightweight, user-friendly tool for basic task tracking and organization.
